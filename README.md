# SmartDobot
Automatic Dobot Magician arm using Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms

SmartDobot is an algorithm to automate a Dobot Magician equiped with a camera, to grip objects; it uses Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms to achieve this goal. It has been realized using:

>>> HARDWARE
Dobot Magician with grip
Logitech fixed focus camera

>>> SOFTWARE
Thonny IDE [v. 3.2.7] & Python [v. 3.7.7]
Sklearn library for ML algorithms
OpenCV library for computer vision utilities
Pydobot2 library for Dobot movements
Other libraries: numpy, pandas, random, serial.tools, time, termcolor

Use this algorithm:
1 - Have a Dobot Magician
2 - Have a Logitech fixed focus camera setted on the Dobot Magician watching floor
3 - Install Thonny IDE (it comes with Python environmet already setted up)
4 - In Thonny: TOOLS > MANAGE PACKAGES || install all libraries
5 - In Thonny: play OpenCV_PositionEstimation.py
